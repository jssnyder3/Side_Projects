    "Ghost notes are an important part of many drum patterns. Similar to shakers, bells, hand drums, and other percussion instruments, they provide additional texture and complexity to the rhythm of a song.\n",

    "Lately, I've been listening quite a bit to my guilty pleasure, Animals as Leaders, an instrumental progressive metal band. Their drummer, Matt Gartska, is _very, very, very_ good (Matt, if you're reading this, I'd like a lesson, please). One of Matt's greatest strengths in my opinion is his ability to play very clean and precise ghost notes within almost any rhythm.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the song, Matt is playing that core rhythm between the kick, snare, and cymbal stack. Hear those ghost notes on the snare drum? At 0:46 in the video, Matt plays the bare bones, \"main beat\" of the song. Immediately following that beat, he adds ghost notes (in addition to some funky cymbal work - let's not think about that stuff for now). The general rhythm is there, but those ghost notes add a wonderful layer of complexity to the beat.\n",
